First we should explore what a content security policy (CSP) actually is and how it can benefit your site. A CSP is a directives based whitelist that is delivered when your page is requested. These directives instruct the browser how it should handle including resources from alien domains.

The [CSP](https://content-security-policy.com/) recommendation has a number of resources that you can use to help harden your website. Some of the common ones that are implemented:

- `script-src`
- `style-src`
- `img-src`
- `font-src`

These directives should contain a whitelist of domains that you want to allow for your website. It is important to remember that if you haven't defined a particular directive in your CSP the default browser implementation will allow all domains.

Let's say we need to include Google Analytic tracking, this requires us to trust a third-party source. If we don't define a CSP the third-party is implicitly trusted, however this means that the third-party could also include scripts from another place. You may never actually know what scripts are being included nor will you know exactly what they're doing.

To ensure that only the script that you're expecting is included you should add directives to your CSP definition which could look like:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' www.google-analytics.com;img-src www.google-analytics.com;
```

This directive would ensure that:

- Scripts can be executed from your domain (using the `self` keyword)
- Scripts can be included from *http* or *https* `www.google-analytics.com`
- Images can be included from `www.google-analytics.com`

Anything that falls outside of these allowed domains would be blocked by the browser and not be allowed to execute on your page. Conversely the missing directives from your CSP would have the browser default effectively allowing everything.

## Report-only

The CSP specification provides an additional header that allows the browser to report on CSP violations as opposed to directly blocking them. This can be useful when attempting to create a robust CSP and is a useful method for testing changes to a CSP before deploying them to your site. A report only mode CSP is added with the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header.

```
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: <policy-directive>; <policy-directive>
```

You should be aware that when implementing a report-only CSP, it is a potential vector for a denial of service attack. When the browser triggers a CSP violation it initiates a request to the configured domain. Unlike traditional requests the browser does not wait for a response from the domain and as a result can initiate a vast number of requests in quick succession.

## Using HTML tags

I spoke briefly about using a `meta` tag in a [previous post](http://steveworley.github.io/2017/01/27/disqus-github-pages.html) lets explore this option a little more as well. This is set using the HTML meta tag `http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"` with the `content` attribute specifying the directives listed above. It is important to note that a CSP delivered via the meta tag will be merged with a CSP header before being enforced.

{% highlight html %}
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="">
{% endhighlight %}

There are some other limitations of the `meta` tag however, it cannot define a report only CSP and cannot be used to whitelist frame ancestors.

### Notes

An interesting thing to note when using the `meta` tag is that this needs to be included in your document before any resources are requested. There has been [some discussion](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/27) about this and it appears to be by design as the spec suggests:

> Authors are strongly encouraged to place meta elements as early in the document as possible, because policies in meta elements are not applied to content which preceeds them.

**For example**:

{% highlight html %}
<head>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
  <meta
    http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
    content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' google-analytics.com">
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example the browser will include jQuery from the remote domain even though a CSP directive for `script-src` doesn't define the domain as an allowed source. This seems to be intended behaviour

## Implementing in Drupal

There are a number of ways that you could implement a CSP in Drupal- you could maintain your own custom module with hard coded explicit CSP lists; you could use a module -- such as security kit -- to manage the CSP via the UI; you could even manage configuration files for the security kit module.

### Security Kit (seckit)

The [security kit](http://drupal.org/project/seckit) module provides allows managing of various security-hardening options via the UI. One of the options that it exposes is the ability to control the CSP.

This method is the most flexible and allows you to manage your CSP dynamically with a configuration UI. It allows you to define all the directives listed by the spec and even allows you to define `report-only` mode mentioned above.
